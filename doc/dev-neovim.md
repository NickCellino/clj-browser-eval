# Developing with an nREPL and Neovim

To compile the frontend code, run
```bash
bin/compile
```

To startup a REPL, run:
```bash
bin/nrepl
```

Then:
1. Start up Neovim
2. Execute file `nrepl_client`
3. Browser should automatically open up to localhost:9000

REPL should be all set and connected to browser!
